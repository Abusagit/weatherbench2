# WeatherBench 2: A benchmark for the next generation of data-driven weather forecasts

![image](_static/wb2-logo-wide.png)

WeatherBench is a benchmark for data-driven weather forecasting models. The goal of WeatherBench 2 is to provide an easy-to-use and reproducible framework for different modeling groups to evaluate their latest AI models. This documentation includes an introduction to how the evaluation code works and what steps to take in order to evaluate a new model in the WeatherBench framework.

As a starting point, we recommend the evaluation quickstart [LINK].

WeatherBench 2 also comes with a set of cloud-optimized datasets. For a list of those, see the data guide [LINK]

For details on the evaluation setup, see the paper [LINK].
For WeatherBench 2 results, see the official website [LINK].
